  <h1> Title </h1>
  <p> Listen to your heart

  <h2>1. Intent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Purpose</li>
    <p> To enable the audience to understand and explore the different types of Heart sounds and their reasons </p>

    <li>Audience</li>
      <p> Curious minds, heart patients, people who keep track of their heartbeat conditions even at home.
      Amateur Medical Practitioners, Community Health Workers </p>



    <li>Context</li>
    <p> We depend a lot on our visit to the doctor to check with what's wrong with our body. Sometimes till the time we take a conscious effort in finding out
      what's wrong with our heart it's too late. As people with layman level medical knowledge, a lot of us are unaware that a heartbeat sound can tell a lot more
      than just the 'lub dub' rhythm and save our time from only waiting for the doctor to decode. People with pulmonary and cardiac problems could benefit much more
      from this and keep track of their heart without paying so many medical visits and draining your mental energy. </p>
    <li> Trigger</li>
  </ul> What triggers me to take this topic is the thought that even though stethoscopes are open for the public to use, we still have problems understanding it. The auditory input isn't
  cognitively decoded well. It'd be nice if we could visually see and understand the ongoings of the heart beats.

  <li>Question</li>
  <p>How can I help educate my audience to visualize and decode the heartbeat sounds?</p>

  <h2>2. Data Abstraction</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Raw Data, Source</li>
      <p> Type of data available - Heartbeat sounds, Types of Heartbeat sounds(normal, abnormal, unlabelled)
      <link> https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds </link>
      <li>Clean Data</li>
      <li>Observations, Features, Sample</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>3. Task Abstraction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you want the user to achieve</li>
    </ul> The ability to understand and explore the various sounds of heart beats and know when it's normal or abnormal.

  <h2>4. Visual Design</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Three Sketches / Inspirations</li>
    <li>Exploration with Data</li>
    <li>Encoding Mapping  </li>
    <li>Aesthetics Choices  </li>
